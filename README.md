## Project Description

The aim of this project is to calculate the proposed taxations to be imposed by the Local Government on product sales in retail stores and analyse the net revenue after taxation.

## Data Source

A list of dictionaries that conatin product information was provided by Azubi Africa. This list of dictionaries was then converted to a DataFrame and used for the analysis.

**Operation**
The Total Profit for each product was calculated using the formula below.
net_revenue_per_product = (retail_price - wholesale price) * sales

**Analytical Questions**
- How much total net revenue received from all of these sales?
- Which productsâ€™ retail price is more than twice the wholesale price?
- How much did the store make from food vs. computers vs. books?
- Calculate the new net revenue after a 30% discount on the wholesale price of goods.
